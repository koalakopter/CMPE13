Collaborated with strategizing how to implement and then implementing the Buttons.c file with Colin Mitchell

This lab was important because it required two new concepts. It first required knowledge of bitmasking and bitwise operators such as NOR, XOR, and AND, and also required knowledge of the hardware and how it worked. Additionally, this is the first lab where we really used the inputs on the board in order to modify code. Exploring the concepts of buttons, switches, and LED's and how they worked with regards to the rest of the board was, in my opinion, the main focus of the land. Furthermore, this is really the first lab where the code inside Board.h was really important or necessary for our coding assignment.

For the most part, I simply followed the order of the lab manual for the order in which I accomplished things. I of course, also read the manual first, but not reading too indepth into it. Thus, I did part 1, made sure that worked, then part 2, et cetera. I had the most trouble implementing part 3 of the lab, seeing as that easily took the most time. I had considerable difficulty implementing Buttons.c, even alongside a friend who I worked with. In the end, we both struggled with understanding how to approach this part of the lab and the lab manual wasn't much help to us either, unfortunately. Additionally, I believe it might have been helpful to cover more of part 3 in class rather than the earlier parts, since those were more straightforward. 

In the end, I think I got it working to an acceptable level. However, there is a lot in the code that I really don't truly understand. For instance, how the timer works. I initially used the timer in part 3 to update the value of button_state(), but it would cause errors. After moving that functionality outside of the timer, it suddenly worked again, though I'm not really sure why. I spent a good deal of time on this lab, easily 20+ hours. The hardest part for me was trying to fix an error where the down-switch, down-button functionality worked as intended, but the up-switch, up-button merely caused the light to flicker on for a moment, then off. I probably spent somewhere around 4 hours trying to debunk this error, and no matter how many solutions I tried, they all produced the same error. In the end, moving the buttoncheck out of the timer function at the bottom seemed to do the trick. In conclusion, the lab was pretty difficult, and I think it might have helped if the lab manual went more in depth for the Buttons.c part. I did, however, like how this lab was in parts, which made the lab easier to tackle and complete.
