This lab built upon our understanding of state machines. However, that wasn't the focus of the lab. This lab focused on the idea of binary trees and recursion, or functions that called themselves. The creation and use of the binary tree was probably the most important aspect of this lab. Learning to traverse the tree with recursive function was the way to approach this lab.

I sort of did this lab in the order it needed to be done. I first started with the BinaryTree.C function, since we needed that to work soundly before we could do any morse stuff. I then created the morse tree and tested it with print functions to make sure everything printed correctly. Then, I moved onto working on the Morse.C function, and implemented the functions contained within that file. When that was finally all done, I moved onto lab8.c file. I started with the helper functions, then moved onto a switch statement that contained all of the tests that would determine what would be printed. I probably should've started this lab earlier, seeing as I probably did not finish up to expectations. Additionally, not having my usual Monday lab probably threw me off. It also didn't help that I went a convention for the entire weekend... In the future, I should probably start stuff on Thursday or Friday, rather than on Monday.

Overall, my lab probably won't end up perfect, but as I write this, I hope I can get it working to an acceptable level. I spent the entirety of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday working on it, which probably totals to around 15 hours of work. Granted, I probably could've gotten this lab done if I had done more work ahead of time. I personally really didn't understand this lab very well and the whole idea of how traversing the binary tree was hard to grasp. For the print function in particular, I kind of just wrote code until something worked, which is definitely not a good strategy. I think lacking a Monday class and having one of the hardest labs fall on a 3-day weekend severely hampered my ability to do this lab. That's unfortunately a mistake on my part, and in the future, I will have to plan ahead better.
