Collaborated with Colin Mitchell on strategizing how to print strings and update the OLED through a print function

This lab applied the knowledge we learned from last lab, that is working with the PIC32 board and its input devices, to create a fully functioning state machine. The idea of a state machine was also explored in this lab, with us implementing a toaster oven with several states. Using states required us to use switches, which in my eyes, are kind of like a glorified, more complex, system of "if" statements". Although the lab manual drew a lot of attention to the timer and the details around it, I did not think that they ended up being as important as a state machine was.

I approached this lab again, by generally following the order listed at the bottom of the lab manual. I first started by creating the main screen, that is the START state, and making sure that everything printed correctly. Next, I implemented a way to switch between cooking modes: bake, toast, and broil. Afterwards, I used the 5hz timer to check if it was a Long Press or a short one, to switch between time and temp. After that, I worked on the countdown part, and made sure it could count down to zero and light up the proper LED's. I then spent a good chunk of time working on the reset part, and tried several implementations. However, upon coming to class on Wednesday, I had to change my code a little bit in the sense that I did not leave the PENDING_RESET phase until button 4 was released or button 4 was held for too long. Finally, i quickly implemented the extra credit using the provided OLED functions, which was surprisingly simple. As stated before, I had the most trouble implementing the long press and its relation to the 5hz timer. However, I got help from a TA on Monday and figured out the problem. I also worked on the beginning with a friend, Colin, to bounce idea off each other after we each separately had brainstormed ideas of how to tackle the lab. 

Overall, for some reason, this lab didn't take as long as the last lab. I suppose I just got lucky and simply ended up hitting less walls along the way. It only ended up taking maybe 15 hours max this time around. I also learned an important lesson with GIT. On Tuesday, with the lab almost done, my computer decided to die, and I lost absolutely everything on it. However, all my files were backed up online with Gitlab, so I ended up losing nothing since I had pushed a very recent version of my lab. I did however, lose my large collection of memes and anime (100+GB), but that's not relevant. Overall, I just want to say I'm thankful for GIT. I liked how this lab felt a little less abstract and weird and more practical in the sense that it might be something you could actually program to a board, rather than a matrix math calculator. I would suggest re-writing the lab manual, since my friend pointed out several errors, including a mention to 5hz event timer flag, which was not mentioned anywhere else and declared not necessary in class. Also, the state machine diagram could be a tad less cluttered for readability.
