Worked with Colin Mitchell, on reading tokens and comparing them to operators, as well as with the Stack functions

	I see this lab as two distinct parts. The first part involved setting up the stack framework. It functioned a lot like lab 3 did, with provided function prototypes and a need to define those functions. Similarily, there was a requirement for a testing framework that mirrored a lot of what happened in lab 3. The next part involved reading a user's input and then breaking down the string into chunks with strtok(). Then, you would manipulate the stack based upon what inputs you are given in order to make the RPN calculator work. I thought the most important aspect of the lab was understanding structs and how to treat the provided struct like a stack.

	My first step when performing this lab was to go through the lab manual first and get a general idea of what to do, but not reading too much into specifics. I then handled the stack functions and the testing in StackTest, and after that was finished, moved onto the RPN calculator and string manipulation. I had quite a bit of difficulty getting the error to work for invalid RPN characters like letters. At first, I tried isdigit(), but for some reason, that broke my code when you tried to input an enter key. My guess is that it triggered the error when enter was pressed and broke the code somehow. I ended up just casting the string token to a float to compare its ASCII value, and that worked for me. Working with my friend, Colin, helped us both to better understand how to use the tokens and how to effectively use pointers.

	I think overall, my code came out alright. I procrastinated a bit much, and that did stress me out a tad bit. Overall, I'd say I spent around 10 hours of work on the lab, give or take some extra time due to goofing around. I thought overall, the lab was fairly clear and my Monday section TA was quite helpful with his help. The lab manual was clear, and I have no qualms with the grading system. Finally, going over stuff about the lab on both Friday and Monday greatly helped my understanding of the lab, so I hope that trend continues.
