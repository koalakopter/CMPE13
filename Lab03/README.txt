Did not collaborate with others, but did help a few neighbors (Nick H, John W) during Monday's lab section.

This lab was all about manipulating matrices and performing mathematical operations on said matrices, which were all 3 by 3 matrices. This lab explored more aspects of functions, and how to take in more complicated inputs. Additionally, we explored more in depth about return types, for functions, using return types like void, int, and float. However, for loops and how to iterate through all 9 elements of a 2-d array were probably the main focus of the lab. Using for loops cuts down on time and writing repetitive code that might otherwise take up time better spent on other things. Finally, we explored, more in depth, how to do unit testing and how the order you create your code mattered. In this case, testing MatrixEquals and MatrixPrint first, to see your outputs easier, made sense going first.

For my general approach to the lab, I first tackled MatrixEquals and MatrixPrint as suggested, but more so that I could see my outputs in a more clear manner. Being able to test a function and then use MatrixPrint to output the result helped immensely on seeing what went wrong in the code. This is in comparison to simply trying to compare an expected result with a hard-coded result and simply seeing a zero, or false, which would not have helped much. I also made extensive use of several online matrix calculators to make sure my outputs looked good compared to another, trusted source. From there, I went down the list and did the functions in order from top to bottom, since the difficulty near the bottom appeared higher to me. If I had to approach this lab differnetly, I probably would've left my tests that I did after I coded each function in to use as my testing harness, rather than deleting all of my test code and re-doing the test harness from scratch, since coding the test harness took up a great deal of time that I just did earlier anyways. Additionally, I attended my Monday section and sought help from my TA, and talked with two friends about the lab, mainly about the test harness section.

In conclusion, the lab went pretty well, and progress was pretty smooth overall, and I didn't really encounter any major roadbumps. I probably spent about 6 hours on the weekend and 5 hours on Monday doing the lab, although this time was probably intermingled with some procrastinating and screwing around. Overall, I liked how this lab was pretty straightforward in what was expected and the mathematical functions could all be easily translated into code. I did not, however, enjoy doing the test harness since it was just essentially me doing 2 hours of hardcoding expected results and comparing them to actual results. I think the point distribution makes sense and have no qualms with it. I think the lab manual was pretty clear and any misunderstandings I had were covered by the TA or on Piazza. Additionally, going over parts of the lab during class helps significantly, since a lot of the time, the concepts used in the lab are from last week and a quick refresher is necessary.
