Collaborated with Colin Mitchell on getting scanf to work, but thats it

This lab probably took 8 hours total? I'm not sure, I wasn't keeping track.

I'd say the hardest part of the lab was getting scanf() to work. For some reason, I had to switch from CoolTerm to Hercules to get scanf() to work. I have no explanation for this
