I wrote: Protocol.C

I think the important aspects of this lab dealt mostly with serial communications and how to communicate betweeen two boards. This involved heavy work with Protocol.C and learning how to decode and deal with the strings being passed in. From what I saw, I think that Protocol.C was much harder to write than Field, but that may be my frustration and bias showing through. An additional final, yet still important, part of this lab dealt with teamwork. It is one thing to write a lab on your own, but cooperating and communicating with a teammate just adds that much more complexity. 

I approached this lab my first reading through the manual, and then focusing on the areas about Protocol, since that would be the parts I'm doing. I'd say my partner and I accomplished Protocol.C and Field.C relatively well. It took time, but we got them both done within a reasonable time frame. Where we are and have been stuck is with Agent. We finished writing the whole thing, but we hit a brick wall when trying to actually play the game and running Battleboats.C. Our UNO's kinda just sit there while sending their data, but never recieving the guess data, which is still confusing me. If I had to approach this differently, I would've started earlier and over the weekend, although this week was unfortunate since I had a work training event and couldn't meet over the weekend. As such, we started working together later than what was ideal.

In the end, we are still stuck, but this could change. We have plenty of late hours between us and tomorrow is a good chance to go to office hours and maybe get our problems fixed. I am still optimistic that we can get this lab done, even if we need to use a few late hours. I think this lab would have surely benefited from a longer time to work on it and a more in-depth manual, since the stuff about how to actually play and run the lab, just aren't present. Additionally, we have no real good way to test Agent.C. For future students, a pre-written test harness might help in testing Agent.c, since we are just throwing code around and seeing what maybe works. Discussion in class helped, but one week flies by, especially with a partner, since you need to organize times to meet and things get real busy around finals week.
