I wrote: Protocol.C

I think the important aspects of this lab dealt mostly with serial communications and how to communicate betweeen two boards. This involved heavy work with Protocol.C and learning how to decode and deal with the strings being passed in. From what I saw, I think that Protocol.C was much harder to write than Field, but that may be my frustration and bias showing through. An additional final, yet still important, part of this lab dealt with teamwork. It is one thing to write a lab on your own, but cooperating and communicating with a teammate just adds that much more complexity. 

I approached this lab my first reading through the manual, and then focusing on the areas about Protocol, since that would be the parts I'm doing. I'd say my partner and I accomplished Protocol.C and Field.C relatively well. It took time, but we got them both done within a reasonable time frame. It took a long time, and a lot of late hours, my partner and I got the lab done Thursday night. We added some really janky fixes, not including a random delay in SEND_CHALLENGE_DATA, and some random puts() statements that break the code. I have no idea why those fixes worked, but I always live by the maxim, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". So in the end, we left those patches in and the code works, but we have no more intention of messing with it.


In the end, we got the lab working, but it took a lot of our sanity and time over the past 4 days. I think this lab would have surely benefited from a longer time to work on it and a more in-depth manual, since the stuff about how to actually play and run the lab, just aren't present. Additionally, we have no real good way to test Agent.C. For future students, a pre-written test harness might help in testing Agent.c, since we are just throwing code around and seeing what maybe works. Finally, we have no real idea how to write a test harness, since the manual just tells us to pass messages in and doesn't really tell us how to approach that. Discussion in class helped, but one week flies by, especially with a partner, since you need to organize times to meet and things get real busy around finals week. Going forward, some extra time to work on this lab for future classes would relieve frustration everywhere
