Worked with Nick Hopwood in understanding how to work with the ListItem struct and how the pointers worked

Like the last lab, the good majority of the lab was in implementing functions around a struct and then testing those functions in a test harness. Afterwards, like with the RPN lab, we moved onto a provided file to implement those functions. The most important part of this lab was pretty similar to the last one, in that in focused on pointers. However, this time, we had to worry about memory, as I did encounter an issue where I forgot to allocate enough memory for my temporary list items which was causing a runtime error.

For this lab, I took an approach that was fairly similar to Lab 3. I first implemented the initalize function that allowed me to start a list and then the createAfter so I could add onto it. Then, I created the print function so I could visually observe what was going on, and that made debugging a bit easier. From there on, I just worked down the list in a pretty random order. If I got stuck on a function, I just moved onto the next one and then implemented it later. I also made the StringCompare function, as was suggested in the lab manual. I later used that in my sort function, which I implemented last. However, I had considerable difficulty implementing the sort function, and it kept giving me wrong answers and I couldn't figure out why. After hours of debugging, I later discovered that in my StringCompare function, I switched a greater than to a less than, which was messing with my ability to compare strings properly. I finally implemented the sorted word count function, using the sort function as a framework. 

Overall, this lab was considerably more difficult than the last one. One factor was probably just the lack of lecture during the week to aid me or a lack of Lab section. I spent maybe around 15+ hours doing this lab, most of which were caused by silly mistakes. I probably have a much better understanding of how pointers and structs work now, but it was not a fun experience getting there, rather it was quite frustrating. I think the lab manual could have went more in depth about pointers and about the heap, since those weren't really covered in the manual. I did however, think that the description and visualization of linkedlists in class greatly helped. Additionally, drawing out how the sort function worked on paper helped me personally, a lot.
