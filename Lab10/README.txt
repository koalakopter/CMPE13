This lab was probably about learning how to use file functions like fopen() and fread(). Learning to read/write to files is very important since that's how like every program or function on a computer works. Instead of writing to a terminal, you are editing or writing to the contents of a file. Additionally, there was some random stuff about UNIX servers and learning to compile on a UNIX server and a bunch of GIT commands thrown in to the mix.

Well first of all, I read the lab like I always do and tried to understand what I was supposed to do. Seeing as UNIX was a bit alien to me, I decided to just plan and write out the program before I worried about the UNIX stuff. The complexity in that regard was about average. However, I simply had no idea how to use the UNIX server and all the commands with the vt100 terminal. In my opinion, these things kind of came  out of left field and learning these things in a week, on top of an already somewhat complex lab was just not something I had the time or willpower to do, especially during finals week. 

In the end, I simply wrote the code to the best of my ability, but have no idea if it truly works since I don't know how to use makefiles or even run the code. So, it probably doesn't work, but I really don't have enough time to fix it, seeing as its finals week and I am quite time-limited. I probably spent much less time on this lab compared to battleboats for sure, but still about average across all the previous labs. In my opinion, this lab came out of nowhere and I was nowhere near ready to take on this task. Having to learn an entirely new platform and method compiling was just not something I could do in the limited time, especially since I used quite a bit of late hours trying to complete BattleBoats. In the future, I hope that UNIX and the like are introduced earlier and students are slowly eased into it rather than just randomly thrown in like this. I am sure some other people know how to use it, but without lab section and limited office hours, its quite hard. As such, I didn't complete this lab to a degree I would be proud of, so my apologies there.
